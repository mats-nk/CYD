# Projects

Because the CYD is a common platform, it makes it really useful for sharing projects. This page will be a list of projects that are available on the CYD.

## Disclamer!

Projects appearing on here is not necessarily a seal of approval from me, I will not be test each project that gets added, so please install these projects at your own risk!

## Adding a project

If you have a project that you would like to add, please feel free to add it to the list!

New projects should be added to bottom of the list.

Some rules:
- Project must be open source
- Project must be functional - It's ok for it to not be finished, but it should do what it says!
